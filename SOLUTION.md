# Solution for Progressive Week API Permission Error

## Problem
You're getting "permission denied for schema public" error when trying to create progressive weeks, even though we've:
1. ✅ Fixed the API route to use `supabaseAdmin` client
2. ✅ Fixed the `.env.local` file with proper service role key
3. ✅ Restarted the development server

## Root Cause
The issue appears to be with your Supabase database setup. Even the service role key is being denied access, which suggests one of these issues:

### Issue 1: Invalid Service Role Key
The service role key might be:
- Expired
- Incorrect
- From a different project

### Issue 2: Database Schema Not Applied
The database tables and RLS policies might not be properly set up.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Verify Service Role Key
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API**
3. Copy the **service_role** key (not the anon key)
4. Replace the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in your `.env.local` file

### Step 2: Apply Database Schema
1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Run the contents of `supabase-schema.sql` file:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of supabase-schema.sql here
-- This will create all tables and RLS policies
```

### Step 3: Verify Database Setup
After applying the schema, test the connection by running:
```bash
node test-connection.js
```

### Step 4: Alternative - Disable RLS Temporarily (NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION)
If you need a quick fix for development, you can temporarily disable RLS:

1. In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
```sql
ALTER TABLE weeks DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE workouts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE exercises DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE sets DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**⚠️ WARNING: Only do this in development. Re-enable RLS before going to production!**

## Current Status
- ✅ API route fixed to use admin client
- ✅ Environment file fixed
- ✅ Server restarted
- ❌ Database permissions still failing

## Next Steps
1. Verify your service role key in Supabase dashboard
2. Apply the database schema if not already done
3. Test the API again

The progressive week functionality should work once the database permissions are resolved.
